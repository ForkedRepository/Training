# Welcome to the Training wiki!

This is for all the new comers to **Agiliq**, you need to do the following tasks to learn and understand Python/Django better.

So lets begin :)

## Python koans

This is the fantastic tutorial to learn the **Python** programming, it covers most the python programming constructs.

Getting started:

* Clone the repository to your local machine from https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans.
* Before you do step one, make sure Python is installed in your local machine.
* In this repository you will find two versions of python, python 2 and python 3. You can chose the version you are comfortable with.
* If you are fixing the test case for python 2, then cd to python2 and run 
    
    python contemplate_koans.py
* Create a github repository and keep pushing your code to this repo as you progress.



Now that you are comfortable with Python, lets learn Django.

**Django** is a python framework for building efficient web applications, you can find more about it here https://www.djangoproject.com/

now your next task is to work through this Django tutorial http://www.tangowithdjango.com/

You will learn the following things from this documentation

* Setup a development environment - including how to use the terminal, the Pip installer, how to work with Git, etc.
* Setup a Django project and create a basic Django application.
* Configure the Django project to serve static media and other media files.
* Work with Djangoâ€™s Model-View-Template design pattern.
* Create database models and use the object relational mapping functionality provided by Django.
* Create forms that can utilise your database models to create dynamically generated webpages.
* Use the User Authentication services provided by Django.
* Incorporate external services into the application.
* Include Cascading Styling Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript within a web application.
* Design and apply CSS to improve the look and feel of the web application.
* Work with cookies and sessions with Django.
* Include more advanced functionality like AJAX into your application.

Again create another github repository and keep pushing your commits as you progress through the documentation
